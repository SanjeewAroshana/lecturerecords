## Manage working and traveling records efficiently


The Lecturer Records system is designed to help the institution manage information about lecturers (faculty) in a structured and accessible way. It provides user authentication (login required) and likely supports operations like adding/Veiw lecturer records, viewing profiles, departments, etc.

The application is currently hosted at: https://lecturerecords.pythonanywhere.com/

 This is supports the administrative needs of the staff/faculty management.
